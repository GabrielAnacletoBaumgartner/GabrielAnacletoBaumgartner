<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Gabriel Anacleto Baumgartner</h1>
<h3 align="center">A brazilian Student of Analysis and Systems Development.</h3>

---

Actually I am unemployed and Studying Analysis and Systems Development at [Unicesumar](https://www.unicesumar.edu.br/).

Learned English by myself playing video games, watching movies and in school with good teachers.
During High School I was the best in chemistry and maths in my class. Not just that, I won a bronze medal during the 13th Brazilian Public School Mathematics Olympiad.
After a while, I quit school due to personal choice and worked in production lines. Come back to study and know I am searching for a Job in the Technology Area.

I learn things fast. So fast that once I was in a programming course, I was the second best studend. Sadly, the programming course was cut and I never got a certificate of conclusion 🙁.
